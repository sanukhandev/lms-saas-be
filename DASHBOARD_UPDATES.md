## Response Format

### Paginated Response

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "message": "Data retrieved successfully",
  "data": [...],
  "meta": {
    "current_page": 1,
    "per_page": 15,
    "total": 100,
    "last_page": 7
  }
}
```

### Chart Data Response

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "message": "Chart data retrieved successfully",
  "data": {
    "enrollment_trends": [...],
    "completion_trends": [...],
    "revenue_trends": [...],
    "category_distribution": [...],
    "user_activity_trends": [...],
    "monthly_stats": {
      "current_month": {...},
      "last_month": {...}
    }

}
```

## Frontend Integration

### Card Organization Suggestions

1. **Top Row**: Statistics cards (Total Users, Courses, Enrollments, Revenue)
2. **Second Row**: Charts section (Enrollment trends, Completion trends, Revenue trends)
3. **Third Row**: Split view - Recent Activities (left) and Course Progress (right)
4. **Fourth Row**: User Progress table with pagination

### Recommended Card Layout

```
[Stats Card 1] [Stats Card 2] [Stats Card 3] [Stats Card 4]
[Chart 1 - Enrollment] [Chart 2 - Completion] [Chart 3 - Revenue]
[Recent Activities] [Course Progress Preview]
[User Progress Table with Pagination]
```

## Benefits

-   **Performance**: Reduced query times and timeout issues
-   **Scalability**: Pagination handles large datasets efficiently
-   **UX**: Better organized dashboard with proper data visualization
-   **Maintainability**: Clean, modular code structure
-   **Caching**: Optimized cache usage for better response times
